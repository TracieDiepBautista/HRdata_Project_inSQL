## PROJECT BACKGROUND:

As a new hire Data Engineer, my first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, I need to design the tables to hold data in the 6 CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, what performance are:

1. Data Engineering | Data Modeling

3. Data Analysis


## THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

i) the .sql is containing my codes in SQL languages to query the data

ii) the schemata.sql is the codes for data modeling

iii) .ipynb checkpoint: Jupiternotebook contains my codes and charts for salary vs title analysis

iv) Outputs | Data: the outputs and resources as csv files and chart from my works


## SOURCES & TOOLS:

in order to finish the analysis, below are tools and resources used: 

i) [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com)


ii) SQL | PgAdmin4


iii) SQLAlchemy


iv) DB Browser for SQLite


v) Python | Matplotlibs

- the most common salary range is 40k which is belong to more than 40 thousands staff in the company; 

- the next range is from 50K to 70K that's falling into nearly 40 thousands staff. 

- the less frequency of salary range is from 110K that just rewarding to less than 1 thousand people in the Company. 

In overall, this Company has a rather fair payroll range to its employees. It would be great if its benefits and allowances come in good package.
